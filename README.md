# ðŸ§¬ Histological Cell Image Classification for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

## Project Overview

This project applies popular **machine learning techniques** to the problem of **classifying data from histological cell images** for diagnosing malignant breast cancer. It follows a **best-practice ML workflow** and simulates a **real-world client scenario**, where the client seeks a reliable and interpretable automated classification system to assist in medical diagnostics.

## Objectives

- Visualise and explore the dataset to understand patterns and challenges
- Apply effective pre-processing and data cleaning techniques
- Create robust training and testing datasets
- Train and tune multiple ML models to find the best performer
- Evaluate model performance using unbiased, statistical metrics
- Interpret and clearly communicate the final results

This project addresses the following Australian Computer Society (ACS) CBOK areas:

- **Abstraction**: Representing the real-world diagnostic problem using models
- **Design**: Developing a scalable and modular ML pipeline
- **Hardware and Software**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
- **Data and Information**: Understanding, preparing, and modeling biomedical image data
- **HCI**: Considering interpretability and transparency of ML output for end-users (clinicians)
- **Programming**: Using Python and relevant ML libraries for implementation

## Methodology

### 1. **Data Visualisation and Exploration**
- Identify patterns, outliers, and data imbalance
- Use visual tools for interpretability

### 2. **Preprocessing**
- Normalise features
- Encode labels
- Handle missing data and noise

### 3. **Dataset Splitting**
- Split into training, validation, and test sets 
- Apply stratified sampling to preserve class balance

### 4. **Model Training & Optimisation**
- Try multiple models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, CNN 
- Use cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning

### 5. **Performance Evaluation**
- Evaluate on unseen test data using metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score

### 6. **Result Interpretation**
- Present confusion matrices and visual explanations
- Provide insights on why the model performs well or poorly
